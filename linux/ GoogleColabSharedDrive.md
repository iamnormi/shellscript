Note: I don't know where does this thread belongs. If I'm on the incorrect section, move it to the correct one.

Many people are literally just selling this method and I feel like sharing this out so that you don't have to pay because the seller just don't do a minute of work to get you the drive.
So moving straight towards the method:

Step I:
Go to this link: https://td.fastio.me/ (mirrors to be left at the last)

Step II:
Type your desired drive's name at the first field and your Gmail on the bottom field.

Step III:
Complete the captcha and hit the GET button and keep the tab/browser open until it says OK.

Step IV:
Boom, you got your UNLIMITED shared drive which can be used to share files and data among those people you add to the drive.

Step V:
You can find your shared drive here: https://drive.google.com/drive/shared-drives
